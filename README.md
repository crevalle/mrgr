# Mrgr

Mrgr is a utility to track open pull requests.  And much more!  Not only does the sophisticated dashboard show custom views based on label, team member, or repo, but also you can ditch the dashboard entirely and get sweet notifications whenever Something Interesting happens!  That way you don't have to check _yet another_ dashboard.

Current notification triggers include: 

* PR has gone dormant
* Controversy is brewing on a PR (lots of comments)
* A specific engineer has opened a PR
* ...and more!

## What do I do with this?

Whatever you want.  This project was originally a commercial application but is now fully open source.  Perhaps you may find it useful to see how Elixir, Phoenix, and LiveView are used in a production application.
